# Retrieve relevant information from a collection of web portals and visualize them

There is a lot of information on the web, and we are always interested in getting the relevant information. The below two scenarios drive the need for it:
- There is usually a specific item of interest, and we try to get all the relevant infomration about the item. 
- We have a question and are searching to find the answers for it that is in the web pages. 

In this code pattern, we try to address a specific scenario where we try to query for relevant information from a group of web pages. [IBM Discovery service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-about) provides the ability to crawl through web pages and build a queryable collection. We will use this feature to build an application using which you can:
- Specify a list of URLs that `Discovery` will crawl to build the collection.
- Specify a query in `natural language` and get relevant results with insights from `Discovery`.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:
- Use the `Discovery` APIs -
  - to create a collection using webcrawl.
  - to get the status of a collection.
  - to delete a collection.
- Parse, read and visualize the results from `Discovery`.
